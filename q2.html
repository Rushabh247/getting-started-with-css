    <p style="background-color: yellow;">
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.<br>
        CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.
        Advantages of CSS
Responsive design - CSS offers features like media queries that enable developers to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent user experience.

Flexibility and Control - CSS provides precise control over the presentation of HTML elements, allowing developers to customize layout, typography, colors, and other visual properties.

Consistency and Reusability - Developers can ensure consistency across the entire website, by defining styles in a central CSS file. Styles can be reused across multiple pages, reducing redundancy and making updates easier.

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) - CSS can be used to structure content in a way that improves search engine visibility.

Ease of Maintenance - Centralized CSS files make it easier to maintain and update styles across a website. Changes can be applied globally, ensuring uniformity and reducing the risk of inconsistencies.

Faster Page Loading - External CSS files can be cached by browsers, resulting in faster page loading times for subsequent visits to a website. This caching mechanism reduces server load and bandwidth consumption.
